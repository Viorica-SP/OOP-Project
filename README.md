# OOP-Project
In this project i wanted to prove my base skills in regard to object oriented programming by doing an simple code that manages the activity of a board game store.


The application does the following:
1. Add a game in the inventory(if the game already exists in the inventory just the quantity of the game will increase)
2. Add a client (the primary key used here is the email for determining the registration of the same client, in this case a message will be displayed in the console: "The client already exists")
3. Add a sale (when a sale is being registered the quantity of the respective board game will be decresed automaticly)
4. Determine the most loyal client (if no client exists, a specific message will be displayed)
5. Determine the best sold board game(if no boardgame exists, a specific message will be displayed)
6. Save the most loyal client and best-selling board game in a text file(the informations will be exported in a text file with the name"file.dat" alongside the time at witch the raport was generated)
7. Display the game list from inventory
8. Display the client list 
9. Display the sales list
10. Increase the stock of a specific board game
11. Exit
